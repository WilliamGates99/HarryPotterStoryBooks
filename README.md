## Description
![Feature Cover](/resources/feature_graphic.jpg)
<br><br>
**Harry Potter** is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling.
<br><br>
The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).

The Harry Potter novels are mainly directed at a young adult audience as opposed to an audience of middle-grade readers, children, or adults. The novels fall within the genre of fantasy literature, and qualify as a type of fantasy called "urban fantasy", "contemporary fantasy", or "low fantasy". They are mainly dramas, and maintain a fairly serious and dark tone throughout, though they do contain some notable instances of tragicomedy and black humor. In many respects, they are also examples of the bildungsroman, or coming of age novel, and include elements of mystery, adventure, horror, thriller, and romance.
